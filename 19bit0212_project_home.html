<h1>About us</h1>
<p align="left">
We started our restaurant in 2020. Initially, it was a small shop that used to sell only roti and vegetable curry. 
But with time, people realized the quality of our products and they helped us to become popular.
We have experienced cooks who will make sure that every food item they prepare are of the best quality. 
We believe that there is no shortcut to perfection, and our belief stands tall because of the examples set by the outstanding work and efforts of our managers, chefs, delivery men. and other staff.
